# Language-Independent Conceptual Frequency Encoding System - Implementation TODO

## Overview
Replace the current BCM (Big Colour Model) system with a true language-independent conceptual frequency encoding system that uses N-dimensional frequency/wavelength/amplitude space, Neo4j graph storage, and Hilbert curve navigation.

## Core Architecture Requirements

### Phase 1: Semantic Space Construction

#### 1.1 Concept Extraction from LLM Safetensors
- [ ] Create `ConceptExtractor` class
  - [ ] Extract token embeddings from all safetensor files
  - [ ] Group semantically similar tokens across languages
  - [ ] Return concept_id -> embedding mapping
  - [ ] Test: Verify "gravity", "gravité", "gravedad" cluster together

#### 1.2 Frequency Space Mapping
- [ ] Create `FrequencyMapper` class
  - [ ] Map concept clusters to N-dimensional frequency signatures
  - [ ] Implement FrequencySignature dataclass with:
    - [ ] Primary frequency (Hz): Core concept frequency
    - [ ] Harmonics: Related sub-concepts (up to 16 harmonics)
    - [ ] Amplitude: Concept strength/importance
    - [ ] Phase: Conceptual relationships
    - [ ] Bandwidth: Concept specificity
    - [ ] Modulation: Dynamic conceptual properties
  - [ ] Test: Similar concepts should have similar frequency signatures

#### 1.3 Hilbert Curve Coordinate Assignment
- [ ] Create `HilbertMapper` class
  - [ ] Map each concept to Hilbert curve coordinate
  - [ ] Implement multiple resolution levels for zoom capability
  - [ ] Ensure similar concepts get nearby Hilbert coordinates
  - [ ] Test: Verify spatial clustering of related concepts

#### 1.4 Neo4j Graph Construction
- [ ] Create `ConceptGraphBuilder` class
  - [ ] Create Neo4j nodes: (:Concept {id, freq_sig, hilbert_coord, languages})
  - [ ] Create relationships: (:Concept)-[:RELATES_TO {strength, type}]->(:Concept)
  - [ ] Index by frequency ranges for fast lookup
  - [ ] Index by Hilbert coordinates for spatial queries
  - [ ] Test: Verify graph structure and indexing performance

### Phase 2: Query Processing System

#### 2.1 Input Encoding
- [ ] Create `QueryEncoder` class
  - [ ] Implement text-to-frequency encoding
  - [ ] Support direct frequency space input
  - [ ] Combine multiple concepts using interference patterns
  - [ ] Test: Same concept in different languages -> same frequency signature

#### 2.2 Concept Space Navigation
- [ ] Create `ConceptNavigator` class
  - [ ] Find concepts with similar frequency signatures
  - [ ] Traverse Neo4j relationships with specified depth
  - [ ] Implement Hilbert-based scale adjustment (zoom levels)
  - [ ] Test: Verify concept traversal accuracy and completeness

#### 2.3 Response Generation
- [ ] Create `ResponseGenerator` class
  - [ ] Generate responses from concept graph only (NO LLM FALLBACK)
  - [ ] Extract key concepts and arrange by relationship strength
  - [ ] Generate coherent response in target language
  - [ ] Test: Responses must be derivable from graph structure only

### Phase 3: Testing Framework

#### 3.1 Language Independence Tests
- [ ] Create `LanguageIndependenceTest`
  - [ ] Test concept mapping across languages
  - [ ] Test cross-language query equivalence
  - [ ] Measure semantic similarity of responses
  - [ ] Failure criteria: >20% semantic difference indicates cheating

#### 3.2 Conceptual Coherence Tests
- [ ] Create `ConceptualCoherenceTest`
  - [ ] Test concept clustering by domain (physics, emotions, etc.)
  - [ ] Test hierarchical relationships (mammal → dog → retriever)
  - [ ] Measure relationship strength accuracy vs ground truth

#### 3.3 Scale Adjustment Tests
- [ ] Create `ScaleAdjustmentTest`
  - [ ] Test Hilbert zoom levels (0.5x = overview, 2.0x = detailed)
  - [ ] Verify response complexity scales with zoom level
  - [ ] Ensure detail consistency across zoom levels

#### 3.4 Anti-Cheating Tests
- [ ] Create `AntiCheatingTest`
  - [ ] Test system fails when concept graph is corrupted
  - [ ] Trace complete path: query → frequency → concepts → response
  - [ ] Monitor for hidden LLM calls
  - [ ] Test concept isolation (remove concepts, system should fail)

### Phase 4: Integration and Replacement

#### 4.1 Replace BCM Components
- [ ] Replace `ApertusWeightTranslator` with `ConceptExtractor`
- [ ] Replace `BigColourChromatThink` with frequency-based system
- [ ] Replace concept-light translators with `QueryEncoder`
- [ ] Maintain same API for `chromathink_chat.py`

#### 4.2 System Integration
- [ ] Update main chat interface to use new system
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling (no mock fallbacks)
- [ ] Integration testing with complete pipeline
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Phase 1.1**: Initial learning and clustering from Apertus safetensors, core concept extraction and frequency mapping
2. **Phase 1.2**: Anti-cheating test framework (implement early!)
3. **Phase 1.3**: Hilbert coordinates and Neo4j graph
4. **Phase 2.1**: Query processing and navigation
5. **Phase 2.2**: Response generation (critical: no LLM fallback)
6. **Phase 3.1**: Adaptive learning, run the same query past qwen3 and update the idea spatial mapping graph weights and fractal depth
7. **Phase 3.2**: Continuously update graph weights and fractal priorities with each question and conversation
7. **Phase 3.3**: Comprehensive testing and anti-cheating audits
7. **Phase 4**: BCM replacement and integration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Language Independence: Same concept → same spatial ID signature regardless of input language
- [ ] Conceptual Coherence: Related concepts cluster appropriately in Hilbert space
- [ ] Scale Adaptability: Hilbert zoom provides meaningful detail variation
- [ ] No Cheating: All responses traceable through Hilbert→concept→graph path
- [ ] Failure Transparency: System fails openly when concepts missing, no hallucination

## Critical Requirements

- **NO MOCK FALLBACKS**: System must fail properly when errors occur
- **NO LLM CHEATING**: All responses must derive from frequency/graph processing
- **COMPLETE TRACEABILITY**: Every output must be traceable through the frequency→concept→graph pipeline
- **LANGUAGE INDEPENDENCE**: Core concepts must be identical regardless of input language

## Dependencies

- Neo4j database
- NumPy/SciPy for frequency operations
- Safetensors for LLM embedding extraction
- Hilbert curve implementation library
- py2neo or neo4j-driver for graph operations

## Testing Strategy

Each component must be tested in isolation before integration. Anti-cheating tests must be implemented alongside each component to ensure no hidden LLM fallbacks are introduced.
